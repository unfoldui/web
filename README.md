## Note:
We are currently using **templates/demo.pug** so that we can avoid accidently publishing in dev work

## Dev setup
Install dependancies currently using **pug** for templating
```
npm i
```

Open templates/demo.pug and **npm start** should get you ready in development mode
```
$$ npm start
```

Once you are done wanted to deploy it **npm run build** should take care of it
```
$$ npm run build
```
